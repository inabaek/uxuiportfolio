      <h1>Conversation card game app</h1>
      <h2>March/2021 - Ongoing | Personal project</h2>
      <h3><b>"Good conversation makes the moment special"</b></h3>
      <p>My friend and I went on a trip. I brought a conversation card game called Table-tok. There are 140 question
        cards in a box. The questions made us talk about a wide variety of things and I got to know my friend better
        through the conversations. After playing the game my friend and I thought what if we make the conversation card
        game as a digital product? So that we do not have to carry the cards around and play the game wherever we go!
        After the trip, I researched conversation games in general, and the research led me to think about how we might
        make the game more engaging and attractive. What makes an enjoyable user experience?</p>

          <p>Imagine you and your loved one are sitting on a sofa at home.
            Now, you have two options to spend time.
            One, spending time on social media such as Instagram, YouTube and Tic-Tok and etc.
            Two, having a meaningful conversation and make special memory between you and your loved ones.
            What would you choose to do?
            Let's say you decided to make a conversation with your loved one. But the thing is you don't know where to
            start.
            Therefore, we decided to make a 'Get To Know You' question card game app. So that you can make a meaningful
            and special memory with your loved ones.

          <p><b>Home:</b> Because Home is where everything starts, I wanted to make it as simple and intuitive as
            possible. Each topic has a drop-down menu of levels to choose from. I came up with the idea of
            multiple-choice questions with a selection button on the top right, so that the user can have more options

          <p><b>Create my questions:</b> Through competitor research, regardless of the online or offline board game, I
            found out that many question card game products provide black cards to make customised questions for the
            users. I thought this idea would rise users' interest in using the product. Therefore, I wanted to make the
            "my question" section at home.</p>

          <p><b>Save button:</b> Since I decided to make the "My question" section, I thought it would also appropriate
            to make a save button on question cards. So that the users can save any questions they like throughout
            playing a game if they want to. </p>

          <p><b>Shop / Settings:</b> This app is categorized as a game. Therefore, I wanted to create gaming elements in
            the product. I came up with the idea of a shop where the users can buy some tokens to open a new level of
            question cards. This also can cover business needs as well as a design goal.

        <p>&#8226; <b>[User testing]</b> I was not sure during the process of case study if this app would be
          competitive in the real world. Through the user-testing, I had some positive responses about the app that they
          would give it a try if it was a real product. I received confidence and courage from the respondents and
          learned how to communicate with the users and develop the project from there.</p>
        <p>&#8226; <b>[UI]</b> I got to use design tools such as Figma and Adobe XD. I learned how to use them.</p>
        <p>&#8226; <b>[Working indivisually]</b> This was my first case study so I didn't have a clue where to start. I
          wished if I could have a team to work with so I can learn from them.</p>
        <p>&#8226; <b>[Designer mindset]</b> To be a better UX/UI designer, I need to keep up with the latest trend and
          test new products so that I can understand the users' behavior. Also, study more about human-centered design.
