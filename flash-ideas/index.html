      <h1>Welcome to my <u>Flash Ideas</u> page!</h1>
      <p>This page is about writing down my flash ideas based on <b>my daily life</b>.<br>
        During learning UX design, one of <b>my hobbies</b> became to think about <b>new user experiences with new
          products</b>.<br> This helps me to <b>keep myself thinking critically and creatively</b>.
        I wish the ideas could become the future products one day!</p>

      <h1>"Food Tracer"</h1>
      <p>I came up with this idea concerning food waste issue</p>

        <h2>My back-story</h2>
        <p>I had a chance to watch a documentary related to the environmental issue. Then I learned one of the huge
          problems is the food waste we make. <br>This leads me to think about how much food waste I make in a day.
          which I wouldn't have been concerned about before.
          I was surprised at how much food waste I make through a day, week, and month! It was much more than I thought.
          <br>Then I started to think what if there is an app that can help us reduce food waste.
        </p>

        <h2>Target users</h2>
        <p>Grocery customers</p>

        <h2 class="reserch-data">Reserch data</h2>
        <h3>(Data from WRAP)</h3>
        <p>- UK households (2018) throw away 6.6 million tonnes of household food
          waste a year in the UK, compared to 8.1 million tonnes in 2007.
          <br>
          - Of the 6.6 million tonnes we throw away, almost three quarters (70% of the total) is food
          we could have eaten (4.5 million tonnes)<br>
          - Estimated annual food waste arisings within UK households, hospitality & food
          service (HaFS), food manufacture, retail and wholesale sectors in 2018 at around 9.5
          million tonnes, 70% of which was intended to be consumed by people (30% being the
          ‘inedible parts’).<br>

          <b>[fun facts – based on 2018 data]</b><br>
          The food and drink we waste, that could have been eaten (the 4.5 million tonnes) would fill:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;• 8 Wembley Stadiums (London, UK)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;• 90 Royal Albert Halls<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;• 38 million wheelie bins (based on a standard 240l)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;• 3,600 Olympic sized swimming pools<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;• 490,000 bin lorries/dustcarts
        </p>
        <h2>The idea</h2>
        <p>Too much food waste...&nbsp; What should we do with this problem?<br>
          I came up with the idea of tracing our food we buy to reduce food waste.<br>
          The idea is like this :<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1. Buy food items in a store.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2. Scan the Items.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3. The scanner will send you a list of the products with every detail such as used by date,
          ingredients, etc.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 4. You can check what you have in your kitchen at a glance on your phone.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 5. The app will send you a notification when the food item is due to expired.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 6. The app will recommend food recipes with what you have in stock.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 7. The app will show you a graph of how much you have saved or waste food this
          day/week/month.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Step 8. Feel proud of yourself!
        </p>
        <h2>The benefit</h2>
        <p>Using this app gives valuable benefits to you and the environment!<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#10004; No printed receipt required (save energy + time + environment)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#10004; Prevent producing food waste (save energy + money + environment)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#10004; Feel more confident about meal plan (save time + food +environment)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#10004;Contribute to saving the earth!</p>
